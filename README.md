# Introduction
Fache is a utility built on top of browser's Fetch API. It caches the result(Response object). When next time you call Fache API, it returns a promise with cached Response object from last call, until it expires.

# Install
For adding directly to a web page, go to `browser` folder and download `fache.min.js`.

If you are developing a web application e.g. React, Angular,etc in a Node environment, then
```
npm i fache
```
Note that, as it uses Fetch API, make sure your application will run in a modern browser. Alternatively, look for a polyfill.

# Use

In CommonJS

```
const fache = require('fache');
```

Or ES6 style

```
import fache from 'fache';
```

# Difference between Fetch and Fache
It has same parameters as Fetch API, https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch. The difference is Fache adds more in the second parameter. 

### Example of fetch
```
fetch( '/api/data', { method: 'GET' } )
```

### Example of fache
It caches the response for subsequent Fache calls for 10 seconds. 
```
fache( '/api/data', { method: 'GET', seconds: 10 } )
```
Default `seconds` is 60.

#### Note that
1. Time to invalidate the cache starts when the first Fache call's response is received.
2. If a subsequent call has same Request or URL but different `seconds` value, e.g. `20`, then it will __NOT__ update the cache lifetime of the first call until the response of first call expires.
3. When deciding if a response will be cached, it starts with checking fache's first parameter to see if they have the same value. Then it shallow compares fache's second parameter value. If it returns true, then the response is cached for `seconds` time.

### More settings of second parameter

| Settings      | Type                 | Description                                                            |
|---------------|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| seconds       | `number`ï½œ`function` | Time in seconds to invalidate cached response after response received. |


#### If `seconds` is a function, e.g. Cache for 10 seconds if response's status is 200.
```
{
    seconds: response => response.status === 200 ? 10 : 0
}
```

### Methods of Fache object

| Method Name             | Description                                                            |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| clearAll()              | Clear all cached responses.                                            |
| clear( urlOrRequest )   | Clear a cached response by URL or Request object.                      |

#### Clear previously sent request by URL.
```
fache.clear( '/api/data' );
```
